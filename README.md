These projects were developed by me during my early programming days, uploaded to Git late for various reasons. This is a small collection of beginner-friendly console programs in C, designed to practice and showcase foundational concepts like pointers, memory management, and basic input/output. Each project highlights essential skills—perfect for those starting out. Here’s a quick overview:
#1. Simple Text Editor
A console-based editor to create, edit, and save text files. It supports basic text input and save/load functionality, giving hands-on experience with file handling and memory management.
Skills practiced: File I/O, strings, memory management  
#2. Unit Converter
A program to convert units like temperature, length, and weight, featuring a menu-driven interface with multiple conversion options. It’s a great way to work with functions and basic math.
Skills practiced: Functions, conditionals, basic math  
#3. Phonebook Application
A contact management program that allows you to add, delete, search, and save contacts to a file. It uses structs and pointers to organize data efficiently.
Skills practiced: Structs, file I/O, pointers  
#4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A fun game against the computer with random moves, score tracking, and a replay option. It’s an excellent exercise in game logic and flow control.
Skills practiced: Random numbers, loops, conditionals  
#5. Basic Calculator
A console calculator supporting arithmetic operations with error handling for division by zero and continuous calculations. It leverages switch statements for operation selection.
Skills practiced: Functions, switch statements, I/O  
#6. Hangman Game
A word-guessing game with a predefined word list, limited attempts, and progress display. It’s a solid introduction to working with arrays and strings.
Skills practiced: Arrays, strings, loops  
#7. Matrix Operations Program
A program to perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication with user-defined sizes and error checking. It dives into 2D arrays and pointers.
Skills practiced: 2D arrays, pointers, functions  
TO RUN
Compile the main file (typically named main.c or similar) using a C compiler like gcc. Run it via your IDE or terminal (e.g., gcc main.c -o program && ./program on Unix-based systems). Follow the on-screen instructions to use each program.
